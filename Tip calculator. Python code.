#Example:
#If the bill was $150.00, split between 5 people, with 12% tip. 

#Each person should pay (150.00 / 5) * 1.12 = 33.6
#Format the result to 2 decimal places = 33.60

print("Hello to tip calculator!")
bill = float(input("What was the total bill?"))
tip = float(input("How much tip would you like to give? 10,12or 15?"))
people = int(input("How many people to split the bill? "))
total_bill = bill + tip / 100 * bill
final_bill = round(total_bill / people,2)
pay = input(f"Each person should pay: {final_bill} dollar")
